[README file](https://github.com/Josia2/CS261-Coursework/blob/main/flask-server/README.md).

# Workflow
To view and assign tasks please use the Kanban board on the
[project page](https://github.com/users/Josia2/projects/1).

# Documentation
To store documentation to be referenced later, pleae add them to the [Notion page](https://www.notion.so/d430ebaf4bda48de93a6824d0dbfc1bb?v=0ea256dd6b2144dfb1f5bdf24a04acb7&pvs=4).

# Final report requirements

- [ ] A small/brief intro of the problem
- [ ] An overview of the system and how it will meet customer needs
- [ ] A discussion of any changes to your original requirements/design
- [ ] A discussion of the development of the product
- [ ] An evaluation of your product
- [ ] An evaluation of your software development process

## Discussing changes
- [ ] What changed?
- [ ] Why was that change made?
- [ ] How did it improve the final product?
- [ ] If you changed requirements - why? How would you solve it in the future?
- [ ] Does your new system still fulfill the customer's needs

## Discussing development

- [ ] How did you go about achieving the requirements?
- [ ] How did implementation proceed?
- [ ] What were the major challenges?
- [ ] Did they affect the project?
- [ ] Did you follow the plan you originally set out?
- [ ] Don't just go into technical descriptions of the code.

## Evaluating the product

- [ ] Show that you met the requirements
- How do you do this?
    - [ ] By testing
    - [ ] Discuss testing - show test logs (don't need printouts of every test)
- [ ] What features does the product still need?
- [ ] What would you do with more time/resources?
- [ ] Is this a good product? If so, why? And if not, why not?

## Evaluating the process

- [ ] How well did the team work?
- [ ] Were you all communicating effectively?
- [ ] Was the original methodology feasible?
- [ ] How was the management?
- [ ] Did the process of development impact the final product?
- [ ] What worked really well, and what would you improve?
- [ ] Team discussion should be general, not personal

## High-quality reports

- [ ] A good product is not necessary for a good report
- [ ] Professional language, good structure, readable diagrams
- [ ] A thorough discussion of the development process and the changes made
- [ ] A nuanced evaluation that discusses the strengths and weakness of both the team and the product
- [ ] Evidence and justification of claims

## Marking criteria

- Readability (20%)
- Project management discussion (20%)
- Software development discussion (20%)
- Suitability of product discussion (20%)
- Product validation (20%)

## Tips and tricks

- [ ] No contents page needed
- [ ] No need for glossaries
- [ ] Don't include code snippets. Use pseudocode if needed.
- [ ] Be consistent in what you are saying (especially in evaluation)
- [ ] Don't repeat yourself
- [ ] Give overviews instead of line-by-line detail (method or component level instead of line level)
- [ ] Justify claims using your data or data from the study/paper
- Need an assigned tester for TDD

# Video presentations

- [ ] About 5 minutes long. 10 is the hard limit.
- [ ] Showcase the key features of the product
- [ ] Highlight how these features meet the customer's needs
- [ ] Ideally, it should show the software running
- [ ] Core features should be discussed in reasonable depth (may need to go into the nitty gritty of algorithms)
- [ ] How is sentiment analysis/prediction evaluated? Why did you choose this?
- [ ] What kind of suggestions (sentiment analysis/prediction) do you include? How?
- [ ] Show off what makes your product unique
- [ ] May want to include slides to go over key content
- [ ] Discuss robustness and how the system deals with errors/issues
- [ ] Do not need to make a pure commercial. They are interested in tech aspects as well as commercial appeal
- [ ] Consider tone, style, humour carefully.

## Marking criteria

- [ ] Delivery - how did you speak and present? How clearly did you get info across
- [ ] Demo - was the product shown well? Does the product have unique features?
- [ ] Technical content - check slides
- [ ] Customer appeal - check slides

## Tips and tricks

- [ ] Voiceover is better than text (although both is best for accessibility)
- [ ] Demo can use a local instance; no need for full server implementation.
- [ ] Do explain technical details such as algorithmic analysis
- [ ] Do not explain every tech details, don't go into detail about the database
- [ ] Don't say what you didn't do
- [ ] Think about how you present yourselves
- [ ] Don't go overboard with editing
- [ ] Not interested in unit tests
- [ ] Show you have met requirments

# Submission

- [ ] Report: Each member submits final report and contribution sheet
- [ ] One team member should submit code base and video presentation (does not need to be the same team member)
- [ ] If code base or video is too large for tabula, email it to James (outlook sharepoint). Title the email "Group 11 - Submission"
- [ ] Do not send github links (they need code base for archives)
